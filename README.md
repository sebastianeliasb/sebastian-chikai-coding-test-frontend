### Structural elements
Structural element names have a strict policy to be simple, clear and descriptive. This element includes React/Typescript components and pages as well as all the main elements of Servers, and normally have to be written with __camelCase__ convention. The exception to this are React components, who are written using __PascalCase__ convention.

### Style elements
Style elements, that includes all _scss_ files and _classes_ have the same rules: lowercase connected by hyphens. The names need to be __descriptive__ but __short__ and, in case they are nested components or classes, should have a reference of their __parent element__ on the name.
